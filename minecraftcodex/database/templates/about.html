<p>Ooh, name it after me! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Pansy. Really?! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip; Leela's gonna kill me.</p> <h2>A Pharaoh to Remember</h2> <p>I can explain. It's very valuable. Oh God, what have I done? Bender, you risked your life to save me! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Why would a robot need to drink? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p> <ul> <li>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</li> <li>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</li> <li>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</li> </ul> <h3>Time Keeps on Slippin'</h3> <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</p> <h4>Where the Buggalo Roam</h4> <p>But I've never been to the moon! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. But I've never been to the moon! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>
